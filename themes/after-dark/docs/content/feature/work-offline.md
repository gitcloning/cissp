Unless running the [Quick Install](../quick-install) After Dark does not require an Internet connection to function. Leverage this feature in creative ways:

- Use [Ephemeral Hosting]({{< relref "ephemeral-hosting" >}}) to report news without tipping off authorities.
- Run your site behind a NAT or firewall blocking all outbound requests.
- Review the [Online Help](../online-help) docs during a flight on Virgin Galactic.
- Keep a personal journal while couchsurfing through Southeast Asia.
- Securely generate configuration for the [Web Mining](/module/toxic-swamp#config-generator) add-on module.
- Develop your content using {{< external href="https://termux.com" text="Termux" />}} on Android in airplane mode.
- Create an [Image Gallery](/module/hall-of-mirrors) while trekking the Mount Nimbus via ferrata.

By default After Dark makes no outbound requests **except** when viewing certain [Online Help](../online-help) documentation to cover related functionality.
