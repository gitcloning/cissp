# DOCKER-VERSION 19.03.1-ce, build 74b1e89e8a
# COMPOSE-VERSION 1.24.1

# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
#
# 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on a host machine
# 2. Copy `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to directory of choice
# 3. Run `docker build .` to build after-dark image
# 4. Run `mkdir -p site/content` to contain your config and site content
# 5. Create a temporary container to copy site config and welcome post from container to host
#    ```
#    docker create -it --name temp $(docker images -q | head -n 1) sh && \
#    docker cp temp:/opt/after-dark/config.toml ./site && \
#    docker cp temp:/opt/after-dark/content/post/ ./site/content/ && \
#    docker rm -fv temp
#    ```
# 6. Add a rule to your hosts file like: `127.0.0.1 after-dark.local` to match traefik label
# 7. Bring the stack up with `docker-compose up -d` then check state with `docker-compose ps`
# 8. If both traefik and web services are up navigate to http://after-dark.local in a browser
# 9. Make a change to the site config for content and watch the page reload with the updates
